# Welcome

Welcome to **Movie Success Analysis** â€” a project that explores what drives a film's box office success and audience reception.  
Through integrating **credits, revenue**, and **audience review text**, this project reveals key factors influencing movie performance both financially and emotionally.

---

# Project Overview

This project investigates two central questions:

- **How do movie credits** (such as budget, cast, and genre) **influence box office revenue?**
- **How does audience sentiment** in reviews differ across genres, and does it contribute to revenue prediction?

We collected and merged data from **TMDB API** and **Kaggle**, including movie details, revenue, budget, cast, genres, and audience reviews.

Our methodology combines:

- **Multiple Linear Regression**: to understand individual variable effects.
- **Random Forest Modeling**: to capture nonlinear interactions and feature importance.
- **Audience Text Analysis**: exploring word frequency, genre-specific vocabulary (TF-IDF), and sentiment analysis.

# Key Highlights

- **Budget** is the most influential factor for box office success, but with diminishing returns as budgets grow.
- **Audience ratings** (IMDB and TMDB) moderately correlate with revenue.
- **Genre** effects are complex and often interact with other variables.
- **Audience sentiment** varies meaningfully across genres but does **not significantly improve** revenue prediction models.
