# 🎬 Movie Success Analysis

This project explores the key factors influencing a movie’s box office performance using data-driven techniques. We combine **machine learning models** (Linear Regression and Random Forest) with **text analysis** on audience reviews to understand both quantitative and qualitative drivers of movie success.

We analyze structured data (budget, genre, ratings, etc.) alongside unstructured review text, investigating how sentiment, keywords, and genre-specific language impact commercial outcomes.
