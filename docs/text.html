<h3>Top Words in Reviews by Genre</h3>
<p>This interactive dual-panel visualization displays the top 10 words
used in movie reviews across different genres. Use the dropdown menu to
explore specific genres.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Left panel</strong> shows the most frequently used words
in reviews for the selected genre.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Right panel</strong> highlights the top TF-IDF (Term
Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) words—terms that are uniquely
representative of the genre.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Hover over each bar to view the exact word frequency or TF-IDF score.
This comparison helps reveal not only what audiences talk about most
often, but also what language is most distinctive to each genre.</p>
